## Docs

The [docs](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/angular/) provide a brief description about the components and services in the library.

The Angular library is created using the [stream-chat-js](https://github.com/getstream/stream-chat-js) library. For the most common use cases our services should give a nice abstraction over this library, however you might need it for more advanced customization, the [documentation](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/js/) is on our website.

## Sample App

This repository includes a sample app to test our library.

To test the app:

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory with the following content:

```
STREAM_API_KEY=<Your API key>
STREAM_USER_ID=<Your user ID>
STREAM_USER_TOKEN=<Your user token>
```

The easiest way to generate a token for testing purposes is to use our [token generator](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/react/token_generator/).

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Preferred Node version: v16.

## Customization examples

This repository includes a sample app that showcases how you can provide your own template for different components within the SDK:

To run the app:

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory with the following content:

```
STREAM_API_KEY=<Your API key>
STREAM_USER_ID=<Your user ID>
STREAM_USER_TOKEN=<Your user token>
```

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `npm run start:customizations-example` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Preferred Node version: v16.

## Local development

STREAM_USER_ID=<Your user ID>
STREAM_USER_TOKEN=<Your user token>
```

Run `npm install` in the root of the project. You can use the `npm run start:dev` command to start the SampleApp with automatic reloading.
