import ChannelHeaderScreenshot from "../assets/channel-header-screenshot.png";

The `ChannelHeader` component displays the avatar and name of the currently active channel along with member and watcher information. You can read about [the difference between members and watchers](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/watch_channel/?language=javascript#watchers-vs-members) in the platform documentation. Please note that number of watchers is only displayed if the user has [`connect-events` capability](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/channel_capabilities/?language=javascript)

**Example 1** - Channel header:

<img src={ChannelHeaderScreenshot} width="500" />

## Basic usage

```html
<my-channel>
  <stream-channel-header></stream-channel-header>
</my-channel>
```

## Customization

### Channel information

You can provide your own template for displaying channel information using the [`CustomTemplatesService`](../services/CustomTemplatesService/#channelheaderinfotemplate)

### Channel actions

By default no channel action is displayed, but it's possible to [add action buttons to the channel header](../services/CustomTemplatesService.mdx/#channelactionstemplate) component. You can follow our [code example](../code-examples/channel-invites.mdx) that implements the invite action (you can implement other kind of actions as well, for example edit).

### Menu button

You can provide a menu button template to the channel header, the [responsive layout guide](../code-examples/responsive-layout.mdx) shows how you can use this to toggle the channel list on mobile screens.
