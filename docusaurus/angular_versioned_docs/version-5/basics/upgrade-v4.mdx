## Highlights

stream-chat-angular@5 brings improvements in the following categories:

- New message menu and message edit UIs to improve usability
- Provide more CSS customization options for the avatar and icon components (to avoid providing a custom component for even basic customization)
- Dropping support for [Angular 12-14](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/angular/basics/angular-version-support/) and [theme-v1](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/angular/concepts/themeing/)

The full list of [features and progress](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-angular/issues/584) are on GitHub.

## Breaking changes

### Angular version support

Angular versions 12-14 are no longer supported. You can use the [Angular update guide](https://update.angular.io/) to update your application.

### Theme v1 is removed

Theme-v1 was deprecated in version 4. Most customers already use theme-v2 which used to be imported from this path:

```scss
@import "stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/scss/index.scss";
```

From version 5 this path should be used:

```scss
@import "stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/scss/index.scss";

// or if you're using CSS
@import "stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/css/index.css";
```

No futher action is required for customers who were already using theme-v2.

Customers who used to use theme-v1 now need to use theme-v2. Updating from theme-v1 to theme-v2 will require to rewrite your custom CSS code as the new theme has a new variable system, and all the components were restructured. To help you get started please refer our [theming guide](../theming/introduction.mdx).

### Removed deprecated features

- The [`MessageActionsBoxComponent`](../../components/MessageActionsBoxComponent) no longer accepts the `isOpen` input, the same is true for the [`messageActionsBoxTemplate$`](../../services/CustomTemplatesService/#messageactionsboxtemplate). The `Message` component will take care of hiding/showing the action box component.

### Type changes

- Event handlers with `Function` type are changed to `() => void`
- Event handlers with `any` return types are changed to `void` return type

## Other changes

### Unused packages

The `ngx-popperjs` package has been deprecated, so you can remove the related packages from your `package.json` file:

- `@popperjs/core`
- `ngx-popperjs`
