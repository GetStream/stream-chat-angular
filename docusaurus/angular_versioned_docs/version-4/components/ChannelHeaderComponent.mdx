The `ChannelHeader` component displays the avatar and name of the currently active channel along with member and watcher information. You can read about [the difference between members and watchers](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/watch_channel/?language=javascript#watchers-vs-members) in the platform documentation. Please note that number of watchers is only displayed if the user has [`connect-events` capability](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/channel_capabilities/?language=javascript)

**Example 1** - Channel header:

<img src={ChannelHeaderScreenshot} width="500" />

## Customization

If you create your own channel header, you can use the [`ChannelService`](../services/ChannelService.mdx) to access the currently active channel. Please note that, the default channel header also contains the menu button to [toggle the channel list](../services/ChannelListToggleService.mdx). Here is a simple implementation of a custom channel header to guide you:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: "custom-channel-header",
  template: `
    <button (click)="toggleMenu()">Menu</button>
    {{ activeChannel?.data?.name }}
  `,
  styles: [],
})
export class ChannelHeaderComponent {
  activeChannel: Channel | undefined;

  constructor(
    private channelService: ChannelService,
    private channelListToggleService: ChannelListToggleService
  ) {
    this.channelService.activeChannel$.subscribe(
      (c) => (this.activeChannel = c)
    );
  }

  toggleMenu() {
    this.channelListToggleService.toggle();
  }
}
```

If you want to create your own channel component check out our [customization guide](../concepts/customization.mdx) for more information.

## Channel actions

By default no channel action is displayed, but it's possible to [add action buttons to the channel header](../services/CustomTemplatesService.mdx/#channelactionstemplate) component. You can follow our [code example](../code-examples/channel-invites.mdx) that implements the invite action (you can implement other kind of actions as well, for example edit).

## Menu button

You can provide a menu button template to the channel header, the [responsive layout guide](../code-examples/responsive-layout.mdx) shows how you can use this to toggle the channel list on mobile screens.
