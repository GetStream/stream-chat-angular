This guide shows you how to add push notifications using [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) to your Stream chat Ionic mobile apps (iOS and Android). This guide is based on the [Capacitor Firebase push notification tutorial](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/push-notifications-firebase#building-the-app--adding-platforms).

## Before you start

If you want to follow this guide make sure to complete our [Ionic mobile app tutorial](./ionic-guide.mdx) first.

## Using the Capacitor Push Notification APIâ€‹

First of all, we need to install the [Capacitor Push Notifications Plugin](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/push-notifications)

```bash
npm install @capacitor/push-notifications
npx cap sync
```

Let's integrate the Push Notification API in our `app.component.ts` file:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { environment } from "src/environments/environment";
import {
  ChatClientService,
  ChannelService,
  StreamI18nService,
} from "stream-chat-angular";
import {
  ActionPerformed,
  PushNotificationSchema,
  PushNotifications,
  Token,
} from "@capacitor/push-notifications";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./app.component.scss"],
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(
    private chatService: ChatClientService,
    private channelService: ChannelService,
    private streamI18nService: StreamI18nService
  ) {
    const apiKey = environment.apiKey;
    const userId = environment.userId;
    const userToken = environment.userToken;
    this.chatService.init(apiKey, userId, userToken);
    this.streamI18nService.setTranslation();
  }

  async ngOnInit() {
    this.channelService.init({
      type: "messaging",
      members: { $in: [environment.userId] },
    });
    // Request permission to use push notifications
    // iOS will prompt user and return if they granted permission or not
    // Android will just grant without prompting
    PushNotifications.requestPermissions().then((result) => {
      if (result.receive === "granted") {
        // Register with Apple / Google to receive push via APNS/FCM
        PushNotifications.register();
      } else {
        // Show some error
      }
    });

    // On success, we should be able to receive notifications
    PushNotifications.addListener("registration", (token: Token) => {
      alert("Push registration success, token: " + token.value);
      // Register to Stream API
      this.chatService.chatClient.addDevice(
        token.value,
        "firebase",
        environment.userId
      );
    });

    // Some issue with our setup and push will not work
    PushNotifications.addListener("registrationError", (error: any) => {
      alert("Error on registration: " + JSON.stringify(error));
    });

    // Show us the notification payload if the app is open on our device
    PushNotifications.addListener(
      "pushNotificationReceived",
      (notification: PushNotificationSchema) => {
        alert("Push received: " + JSON.stringify(notification));
      }
    );

    // Method called when tapping on a notification
    PushNotifications.addListener(
      "pushNotificationActionPerformed",
      (notification: ActionPerformed) => {
        alert("Push action performed: " + JSON.stringify(notification));
      }
    );
  }
}
```

We are adding `alert` calls to the various events to be able to observe the behaviour when the app is running on mobile devices.

After this, you'll want to generate a new build and let Capacitor know about the changes. You can do that with:

```bash
ionic build
npx cap copy
```

## Creating a Firebase project

Complete the [Creating a Project for your App on Firebase step](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/push-notifications-firebase#creating-a-project-for-your-app-on-firebase) in the Capacitor Push guide.

## Integrate with Android

Complete the [Android integration steps](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/push-notifications-firebase#android) in the Capacitor Push guide.

## Integrate with iOS

Complete the [iOS integration steps](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/push-notifications-firebase#ios) in the Capacitor Push guide.

## Integrate with Stream API

This guide doesn't give you an in-depth overview of the Stream Push API, if you want to know more about that visit our [push documentation](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/push_introduction/?language=javascript).

:::important
This guide uses the [Push v2](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/upgrading_to_push_v2/?language=javascript) Stream API.

### Firebase configuration in Stream Dashboard

To be able to receive notifications from Stream, you need to provide your Firebase credentials to Stream.

Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), and select the project your app belongs to.

Click on the gear icon next to **Project Overview** and navigate to **Project settings**.

Navigate to the **Service Accounts** tab. Under **Firebase Admin SDK section**, click on **Generate new private key** button that will generate a _JSON_ file with the Firebase Credentials.

Open the [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/) and navigate to your application.

Select **Push notifications** from the left menu.

Add a new **Firebase** configuration.

Upload the _JSON_ file you created in the Firebase console.

For more information about push configurations see our [Push Providers & Multi Bundle guide](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/push_providers_and_multi_bundle/?language=javascript)

### Push templates in Stream Dashboard

The [Capacitor Push API has some limitations around data-only notifications](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/push-notifications#silent-push-notifications--data-only-notifications). The default Firebase APN notification payload works well with the Capacitor Push API, but if you need to send notifications for Android you have to update the **Notification Template** in the **Push Notifications** settings in the **Stream Dashboard**.

Here is an example **Notification template**

```
{
    "title": "{{ sender.name }} @ {{ channel.name }}",
    "body": "{{ truncate message.text 2000 }}",
    "click_action": "OPEN_ACTIVITY_1",
    "sound": "default"
}
```

You can read more about templates in our [Push Templates in v2 guide](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/push_templates_in_v2/?language=javascript).

Add the following code to your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file to open the app if the notification is clicked:

```
<intent-filter>
  <action android:name="OPEN_ACTIVITY_1" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
</intent-filter>
```

Add this element as a child to the `activity` element. "OPEN_ACTIVITY_1" is the "`click_action`" field from your Firebase Notification template.
