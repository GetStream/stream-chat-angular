The current version of the SDK supports all Angular versions starting from Angular 12. However since [Angular itself doesn't support versions 12-14 anymore](https://angular.io/guide/releases#actively-supported-versions) the SDK will drop support for these in Q2 2024 (this will be released in a major release). Moving forward our version support policy will be matched more closely with the Angular's official [support window](https://angular.io/guide/releases#support-window). You can update your Angular application following the official [Angular update guide](https://update.angular.io/).
