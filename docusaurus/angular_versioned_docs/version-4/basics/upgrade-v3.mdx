## About version 4

Version 4 of `stream-chat-angular` brings a new and improved theming system. To use the new system please refer to our new [theming guide](../theming/introduction.mdx).

## Theme-v1

The old theme can still be used with the latest SDK versions however, you might need to update your custom CSS as some changes were introduced to theme-v1.

Updating from theme-v1 to theme-v2 will require to rewrite your custom CSS code as the new theme has a new variable system, and all the components were restructured.

Theme-v1 is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

## Thread layout

Previously you had to provide a selector for the message list and message input component projected inside the [thread component](../components/ThreadComponent.mdx).

```html
<stream-thread name="thread">
  <stream-message-list
    name="thread-message-list"
    mode="thread"
  ></stream-message-list>
  <stream-message-input
    mode="thread"
    name="thread-message-input"
  ></stream-message-input>
</stream-thread>
```

You don't need to provide those selectors anymore, anything inside the content part of `stream-thread` HTML element will be projected inside the thread component:

```html
<stream-thread name="thread">
  <stream-message-list mode="thread"></stream-message-list>
  <stream-message-input mode="thread"></stream-message-input>
</stream-thread>
```

Providing the selector won't cause a problem, but it's unnecessary.

## `device-width` module was removed

The `device-width` utility module was removed. If you rely on this code inside your chat application, you'll have to update your code.
