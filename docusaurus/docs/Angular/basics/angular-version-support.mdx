## Angular version support policy:

- We're doing our best to introduce support for the latest Angular version as soon as it becomes stable
- To be able to use new features of Angular, we need to remove support for older Angular versions, however we always make sure to support [all actively supported Angular versions](https://angular.dev/reference/versions#actively-supported-versions)
