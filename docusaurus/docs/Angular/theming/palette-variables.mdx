A color palette is defined inside the library that used to define default values for the [global theme variables](./global-variables.mdx). If you want to work with the default theme but want to adjust the shades (for example, change `blue500` to a lighter color), you can update the palette variables. However, if you want to change the color scheme of the theme (for example, change the primary color from blue to green), you should take a look at [global theme variables](./global-variables.mdx).

You can find the [list of palette variables on GitHub](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-css/blob/main/src-v2/styles/_palette-variables.scss).
