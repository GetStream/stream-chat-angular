CSS variables are the easiest way to customize the theme. The variables are organized into two layers:

- Global
- Component

Global variables change the layout/look-and-feel of the whole chat UI, meanwhile component variables change only a part of it (for example message component).

Global variables can be grouped into the following categories:

- **Theme**: colors, typography and border radiuses ([list of global theme variables](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-css/tree/v4.18.0/src/v2/styles/_global-theme-variables.scss))

- **Layout**: spacing (padding and margin) and sizing ([list of global layout variables](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-css/tree/v4.18.0/src/v2/styles/_global-layout-variables.scss))

If you find that these variables are too high-level and you need more granular control, you also have the option to provide [component layer overrides](./component-variables.mdx).
