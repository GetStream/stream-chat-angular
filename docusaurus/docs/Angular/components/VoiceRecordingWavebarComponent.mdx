import WavebarScreenshot from "../assets/wavebar-screenshot.png";

This component can be used to visualize the wave bar of a voice recording

<img src={WavebarScreenshot} width="500" />

## Usage

The built-in [`AttachmentListComponent`](../../components/AttachmentListComponent) component displays this component. If you want to use this directly in your UI you can do it like this:

```html
<audio #audioElement></audio>
<stream-voice-recording-wavebar
  *ngIf="attachment?.waveform_data && attachment?.duration"
  [waveFormData]="attachment?.waveform_data || []"
  [duration]="attachment?.duration"
  [audioElement]="audioElement"
></stream-voice-recording-wavebar>
```

## Customization

It's not possible to override only the wave data visualization, but you can override the [`VoiceRecordingComponent`](../services/CustomTemplatesService.mdx/#voicerecordingattachmenttemplate).
