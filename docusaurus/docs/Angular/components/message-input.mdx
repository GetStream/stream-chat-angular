The `MessageInput` component displays an input where users can type their messages and upload files, and sends the message to the active channel.

## Customization

If you want to create your own message input, here is how to use it:

```html
<stream-channel-list></stream-channel-list>
<stream-channel>
  <stream-channel-header></stream-channel-header>
  <stream-message-list></stream-message-list>
  <custom-message-input></custom-message-input>
</stream-channel>
```

:::note
If you want to create your own message input, you can use the [`ChannelService`](../services/channel.mdx) to send messages.
