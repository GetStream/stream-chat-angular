The `ChannelPreview` component displays a channel preview in the channel list, it consists of the image, name (or list of members if name isn't defined) and latest message of the channel.

<img src={ChannelPreview} width="500" />

## Basic usage

The `ChannelPreview` component is displayed inside the built-in [channel list component](../../components/ChannelListComponent). If you're building you own channel list, this is how you can use this component:

```html
<stream-channel-preview [channel]="channel"></stream-channel-preview>
```

## Customization

1. You can provide your own template for the channel preview info (marked with the red rectangle on the screenshot) by providing your own template for the [`customTemplatesService.channelPreviewInfoTemplate$`](../../services/CustomTemplatesService/#channelpreviewinfotemplate).

<img src={ChannelPreviewInfo} width="500" />

2. If you want to customize the channel avatar, please refer to the [avatar customization section](../../components/AvatarComponent/#customization)

3. You can replace the whole component by providing your own template for the [`customTemplatesService.channelPreviewInfoTemplate$`](../../services/CustomTemplatesService/#channelpreviewtemplate).

4. The [`MessageService`](../services/MessageService.mdx) provides some customization options for message display the are applied to both the message and channel preview components
