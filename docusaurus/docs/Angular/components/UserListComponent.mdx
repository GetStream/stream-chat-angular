The `UserListComponent` can display a list of Stream users with pagination. This can be useful if you want to build a user list in your application.

## Usage

The user list component relies on data provided by the parent component:

```html
<stream-user-list
  [users]="<list of users to display>"
  [isLoading]="<set to true to display loading indicator>"
  [hasMore]="<whether or not the list has more pages to retrieve>"
  (loadMore)="<use this output to fetch the next page of users>"
></stream-user-list>
```

## Customization

The component is built on top of the [`PaginatedListComponent`](../../components/PaginatedListComponent.mdx), you can use that component to build your own user list component.

[//]: # "Start of generated content"
[//]: # "End of generated content"
