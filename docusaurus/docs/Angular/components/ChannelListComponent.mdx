The `ChannelList` component renders the list of channels.

The `ChannelList` displays channels using pagination, new channels are loaded if the user clicks the "Load more" button.

The channel list is always visible on desktop devices, on mobile devices, the list can be opened or closed controlled by a button in the [`ChannelHeader`](./ChannelHeaderComponent.mdx) component.

## Customization

### UI customization

**Example 1** - Using a custom channel list component

See our [customization guide](../concepts/customization.mdx) on how to provide your own channel list component.

**Example 2** - Using a custom channel preview component

If you only want to customize the channel preview items (not the whole list), see the [channel preview customization](./ChannelPreviewComponent.mdx/#customization) guide.

**Example 3** - Content injection points

It's possible to inject your own content to the top or to the bottom of the channel list:

```html
<stream-channel-list>
  <input channel-list-top placeholder="Search" />
  <button channel-list-bottom>Add new channel</button>
</stream-channel-list>
```

Use the `channel-list-top` attribute to inject content at the top of the channel list, and the `channel-list-bottom` to display content at the bottom of the channel list.

### Behavior customization

Please refer to the [channel list guide](../../concepts/channel-list/)
