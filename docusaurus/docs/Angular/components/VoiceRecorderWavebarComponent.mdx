The `VoiceRecorderWavebarComponent` displays the amplitudes of the recording while the recoding is in progress

<img src={VoiceRecorderWavebar} width="500" />

The component doesn't have any inputs, instead it uses the [`AudioRecorderService`](../../services/AudioRecorderService.mdx) and the [`AmplitudeRecorderService`](../../services/AmplitudeRecorderService.mdx) to gather all necessary data.

## Usage

```html
<stream-voice-recorder-wavebar
  *ngIf="isRecording$ | async"
></stream-voice-recorder-wavebar>
```

```typescript
isRecording$: Observable<boolean>;

constructor(public readonly recorder: AudioRecorderService) {
    this.isRecording$ = this.recorder.recordingState$.pipe(map(s => s === MediaRecordingState.RECORDING || s === MediaRecordingState.PAUSED));
}
```
