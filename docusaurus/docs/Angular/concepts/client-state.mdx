## Creating a client

To connect a user, you need to have a client. This is how you can create one:

```ts
import { ChatClientService } from "stream-chat-angular";

export class AppComponent {
  constructor(private chatService: ChatClientService) {
    this.chatService.init(
      "<API key>",
      "<user or id>",
      "<token or provider>",
      "<client options>"
    );
  }
}
```

The Angular SDK uses the [stream-chat-js client](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js) under the hood, but most of the time you don't need to interact with the client directly, instead, you'll use the [`ChatClientService`](../../services/ChatClientService) or [`ChannelService`](../../services/ChannelService). However, it's still possible to access the client directly:

```ts
import { StreamChat } from "stream-chat";

// only possible to do after chatService.init was called
const client: StreamChat = this.chatService.chatClient;

// independently from chatService
const client: StreamChat = StreamChat.getInstance("<API key>");
```

The `StreamChat` client uses singleton pattern to ensure only one instance is created, so you'll get the same instance with both methods

You can refer the [stream-chat-js client documentation](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/?language=javascript) to understand the most important concepts of the Stream API.

## Client options

Optionally you can provide configuration options to the client using the `init` method. Here is a simple example that sets the timeout for HTTP requests, and provide `console.log` for logging.

```ts
this.chatService.init("<API key>", "<user or id>", "<token or provider>", {
  timeout: 10000,
  logger: console.log,
});
```

## Connecting and disconnecting users

Please refer to the [Users and tokens guide](../../concepts/users-and-tokens/).
